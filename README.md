# data_technologies_project
##OVERVIEW:

This is my repository for my final statistical data technologies class (Winter 2021). I will deploy a Shiny app that allows a user to choose a company that is
listed on the NASDAQ, and will display the companies most recent annual earnings data (in a histogram), as well the company's Shiller P/e, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E,
and a plot of the company's stock price, the NASDAQ, and the S&P 500
